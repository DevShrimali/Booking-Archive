## Current Copy Audit

### Hero Section

#### Current Copy
```
Vol. 2024 — Global Index

ARCHIVE
Travel

A curated digital museum of high-end destinations.
Precision, speed, and kinetic energy.
```

#### Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ✅ "Archive Travel" is unique and memorable
- ✅ "Curated digital museum" creates intrigue
- ✅ "Vol. 2024 — Global Index" adds editorial credibility

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Headline doesn't communicate clear value proposition
- ❌ "Precision, speed, and kinetic energy" is vague/abstract
- ❌ Doesn't answer: "What do I get?" or "Why should I care?"
- ❌ No emotional connection to travel desires
- ❌ Missing clear benefit statement

**Copywriting Principles Violated:**
1. **Clarity over cleverness** - "Archive" is clever but unclear
2. **Benefits over features** - Describes what it IS, not what it DOES for you
3. **Specificity over vagueness** - "Precision, speed, kinetic energy" = marketing buzzwords
